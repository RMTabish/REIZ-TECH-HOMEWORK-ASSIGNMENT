# REIZ-TECH-HOMEWORK-ASSIGNMENT
This repository contains my solutions for two questions as part of the first assignment for the .NET Developer Intern position.

# Question 1: Analog Clock Angle Calculation
In this task, I have created a console application that allows the user to input the hours and minutes of an analog clock. The program calculates the lesser angle in degrees between the hour hand and the minute hand of the clock and displays the output in the console window.

To run the program, execute the console application and follow the prompts to input the hours and minutes of the clock. The program will then calculate the angle and display the result.

# Question 2: Hierarchical Structure
In this task, I have implemented a hierarchical structure using the Branch class. The Branch class represents a node in the hierarchical structure and contains a list of child branches.

The structure allows for the creation of objects of type Branch, which can be added to the branches list, effectively increasing the depth of the hierarchy. The newly created branches can further have their own child branches, and the process can continue indefinitely.

To utilize this hierarchical structure, create an instance of the Branch class and add new branches to the branches list as desired. This allows for building a hierarchical structure with varying depths.

# Approach to Answers
The first qurestion i calculated the angle of each one i.e the hour and minute then found the greater angle and smaller one is subtrated from it.
The second question was solved with a simple recursive approach for a bigger problem i could have used memoization tecnique but didnt thought it necessary here.
